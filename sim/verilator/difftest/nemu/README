Building shared lib from NJU nemu
1. Need to disable "Enable address sanitizer" in menuconfig. This will create issue in verilator
2. Need to add CFLAGS -lreadline when generating shared lib. Otherwise, we will get error in dlopen: "undefined symbol: readline"
3. Need to disable "Initialize the memory with random values" otherwise some diff test might fail because the read data from memory might not match
